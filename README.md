# Text Adventure in C

## Intro

This started off as a way of learning C, but has evolved into a parser / interpreter project in an attempt to do something more interesting with the concept.

I've always had an interest in text adventures; in fact I learned to program in JavaScript back in the early 2000s by programming simple text adventures in a Delphi-based editor.

As an avid reader of fantasy, and later 'serious', literature there's something viscerally appealing about text adventures; they're stripped-back, minimal versions of games. Similar to how C is a stripped-back, minimal programming language.
